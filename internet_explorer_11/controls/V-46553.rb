Such software can pose significant security and privacy risks to networks. This policy setting enables blocking of ActiveX control installation prompts for Internet Explorer processes. If you enable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will be blocked for Internet Explorer processes. If you disable this policy setting, prompts for ActiveX control installations will not be blocked and these prompts will be displayed to users. If you do not configure this policy setting, the users preference will be used to determine whether to block ActiveX control installations for Internet Explorer processes.'
