On Windows Systems (From Windows Explorer):

Browse to the %ORACLE_HOME\database\directory.

Select and right-click on the PWD%ORACLE_SID%.ora file, select Properties, select the Security tab.
Substitute %ORACLE_SID% with the name of the ORACLE_SID for the database.

	tag "fix": "Disable use of the remote_login_passwordfile where remote administration is not authorized by specifying a value of NONE.

If authorized, restrict use of a password file to exclusive use by each database by specifying a value of EXCLUSIVE.

From SQL*Plus:

alter system set remote_login_passwordfile = 'EXCLUSIVE' scope = spfile;

OR

alter system set remote_login_passwordfile = 'NONE' scope = spfile;

The above SQL*Plus command will set the parameter to take effect at next system startup.

Restrict ownership and permissions on the Oracle password file to only the DBMS software installation account.
